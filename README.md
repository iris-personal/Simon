<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Screenshot 1](https://i.imgur.com/WABdGWg.png)

The original Simon was an instant success after it was released in 1978. Inspired by the Atari game 'Touch Me', Richard Baer, the Father of the Video Game, took on the project of creating the wildly popular game. Growing up, this game was one I enjoyed. I am happy to contribute to its legacy. With it's sleek design and retro color pallete, all you have to do to test your skills at this game is let the pattern play and try your memory by clicking the blocks to reproduce it.
